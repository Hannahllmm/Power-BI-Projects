# Power BI Projects
These are the Power BI projects I've worked on in my spare time. I pick and choose prodjects to complete from [Workout Wednesday](https://workout-wednesday.com/power-bi-challenges/) and [Makeover Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/). This is where I keep track of the projects I've worked on.
